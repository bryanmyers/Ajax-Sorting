Ajax-Sorting
============
Ajax Sorting was written in PHP with a MySQL backend. The project was to mimic features you see on the large high end sites such as Google.  What this does is allow you to search a large database, with the search results being returned in real time with each keypress.  In addition pagination is used to keep the results table display to a manageable list.  This project has not been refactored.
